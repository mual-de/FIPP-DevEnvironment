# FIPP-DevEnvironment
This repository contains a whole development environment for the fast image processing pipeline library. 

It combines several repositories:

- FIPP (core library)
- FIPP-Plugins
- FIPP-ImageProcessing

Additionally a docker file for nvidia-docker is included. All Repositories are going to get cloned inside this container.
The main purpose of this repository is to provide a development environment for developing plugins while improving the core libraries. If you are only interested in developing a FIPP-Plugin, please use the Dockerfiles provided inside FIPP-Plugins.
